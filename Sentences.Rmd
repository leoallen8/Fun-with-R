## Sentences

This code will randomly select a subject, verb, and object from the lists and combine them into a sentence. You can also modify the lists or add more lists to generate more complex sentences.

```{r}
# create a list of subjects, verbs, and objects
subjects <- c("I", "You", "He", "She", "They")
verbs <- c("eat", "sleep", "run", "play", "study")
objects <- c("pizza", "music", "football", "books", "games")

# generate a random sentence
paste(sample(subjects, 1), sample(verbs, 1), sample(objects, 1))


```
